	 Vim is a very powerful editor that has many commands, too many to
	     explain in a tutor such as this.  This tutor is designed to describe
	     enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as
	     an all-purpose editor.
	
	     The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 25-30 minutes,
	     depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.
	
	     ATTENTION:
	     The commands in the lessons will modify the text.  Make a copy of this
	     file to practice on (if you started "vimtutor" this is already a copy).
	
	     It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by
	     use.  That means that you need to execute the commands to learn them
	     properly.  If you only read the text, you will forget the commands!
	
	     Now, make sure that your Caps-Lock key is NOT depressed and press
	     the   j   key enough times to move the cursor so that lesson 1.1
	     completely fills the screen.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
				Lesson 1.1:  MOVING THE CURSOR
	
	
	   ** To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated. **
		     ^
		     k		    Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.
	       < h	 l >		   The l key is at the right and moves right.
		     j			   The j key looks like a down arrow.
		     v
	  1. Move the cursor around the screen until you are comfortable.
	
	  2. Hold down the down key (j) until it repeats.
	     Now you know how to move to the next lesson.
	
	  3. Using the down key, move to lesson 1.2.
	
	NOTE: If you are ever unsure about something you typed, press <ESC> to place
	      you in Normal mode.  Then retype the command you wanted.
